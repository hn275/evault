# Getting Started

We're using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for python development.

Note: that there is a CI for Python 3.12 and 3.13, any other versions are not tested and may not work.

## Docker

The recommended way is to use docker compose.

```sh
docker compose up
```

First time running, the database will need to be migrated.

```sh
docker exec -it evault-server sh -c 'uv run alembic upgrade head'
```

## Run it locally

1. Creating/using a virtual environment

```sh
uv venv --python 3.13 # creating a venv for python 3.13
uv venv # sourcing the environment
```

2. Install all project deps. Reminder to activate your virtual environment.

```sh
uv sync
```

3. Migrate database to the latest revision.

```sh
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

4. Start server

```sh
uv run fastapi dev server/main.py
```

There's a Docker Compose `compose.yml` file for Redis + PostGreSQL server.
Mapping to the ports 5432 and 6379 respectively.

```sh
docker compose up -d
```
